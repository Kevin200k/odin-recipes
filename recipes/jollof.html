    <p><h2>Description</h2></p>
    <br>
    <p> The Ghanaians prefer perfumed Thai jasmine rice, with a distinct aroma, which is one of the big points of differentiation of this jollof dish. Ghanaian jollof usually includes more spices than the Nigerian rice recipe; for example, ginger and garlic are blended into the pepper mix. Asides from curry powder, it could also be cooked with one or more of nutmeg, turkey berry, anise, Rosemary, bay leaves etc, as well as mixed vegetables. Ghana jollof rice is served with shito as a topping, and fried plantain, meat or fish as sides.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Red bell pepper</li>
        <li>Tomatoes</li>
        <li>Onion</li>
        <li>Scotch bonnet pepper</li>
        <li>Sunflower oil</li>
        <li>Tomato paste/puree</li>
        <li>Dried thyme leaves</li>
        <li>Chicken stock cubes</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Wash the tomatoes and peppers. Remove the stalk from the peppers. Peel the onions. Wash the rice under a cold tap until the water runs clear, and drain in a colander.</li>
        <li>Cut one onion into quarters and add into a blender. Add three tomatoes, red bell pepper and scotch bonnet pepper, then add half a cup of water and liquidize until smooth. Keep aside.</li>
        <li>Chop the remaining onion. Slice the remaining tomatoes thinly.</li>
        <li>Heat the oil in a pan under medium heat, then pour the chopped onions. Cook until the onions start to brown.</li>
        <li>Add the blended pepper mix, curry powder, thyme, bouillon cubes, and bay leaves into the panâ€”Cook for 20 mins making sure to stir occasionally. Then add the tomato paste and the sliced tomatoes. Reduce the heat and allow simmer until the moisture reduces significantly and the oil separates to settle on the surface. This sauce is key to getting the jollof right; this is where the jollof flavours and aroma develop.

        </li>
        <li>Bring back the heat to medium. Add the washed rice and the stock, then add two cups of water and taste for salt. Cover the pot.
